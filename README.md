# cs-operating-system
practice and projects for combined courses from GIT CS 8803-002 and Stanford CS140(basic level)

I will put a mind map here as soon as I finish each chapter. Basically I will follow the order as in [Introduction to Operating System on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923/lessons/3014898657/concepts/30515485910923) to complete the whole course.
